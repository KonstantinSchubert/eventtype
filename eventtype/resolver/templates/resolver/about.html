        <h1>LHCb Event Type Explainer</h1>

    <p class="lead"> Online tool to help ease the confusion that comes with LHCb event type.</p>

    <p class="lead">The goal is to provide both 
    <ul>
        <li> a tool that deciphers the meaning of a given event type</li> 
        <li> and a wizard that helps find the correct event type of a decay.</li>
    </ul>
    The former of which can be tested, the latter is still a concept only.</p>
