            You have reached the end of this wizard.<br>
            Parts of the event number that could not be determined are marked with X.<br>
            The last two digits are rarely defined and can be set by the user.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="lead"> 
            If you're wondering which event types are taken, maybe the <a href="http://lhcbdoc.web.cern.ch/lhcbdoc/decfiles/">list of all LHCb DECFILES with corresponding event type</a> can help. </p>
        <p class="lead"> 
            If you think that the wizard could do better, or if you found a bug, <a href="https://github.com/KonstantinSchubert/eventtype/issues"> open an issue on Github.</a>

            This online tool aims to implement the specification in <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/855452?ln=en"> the event type numbering reference </a>.
            However, there are particular cases that are not described in the note - or are not covered yet and where only the LHCb Gauss Managers can make a decision.
            Also, implementation mistakes are to be expected at any level.
